# Overview
This repository contains a project focused on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Experiments were conducted on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets.

After training the models from scratch, fine-tuning was performed on a pre-trained model using a different dataset. The models implemented include: Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs); Convolutional Neural Networks, with a focus on ResNet architectures.

The code does not necessarily need to be executed. If youâ€™re only interested in the results, you can simply refer to the report provided in the `relazione.pdf` file.
