### Overview
This repository contains a project focused on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

Experiments were conducted on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets.

The models implemented include:
- Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs)
- Convolutional Neural Networks, with a focus on ResNet architectures

After training the models from scratch, fine-tuning was performed on a pre-trained model using a different dataset.
